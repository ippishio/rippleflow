### Mobile **XRPL** wallet with unique features, that should simplify work with transactions

## Getting started
- Clone the repo and build it in Android Studio:
```git clone https://github.com/ippishio/rippleflow/```
- Or just [download](https://github.com/ippishio/rippleflow/blob/master/rippleflow-build.apk) APK from build folder
  

## Inspiration
The main goal of the project is to create a user-friendly app for people with little to no experience in dealing with cryptocurrencies, with intuitively clear functions that can assist users in various ways with their XRP wallets.

## What it does
It helps easily send XRP and other cryptocurrencies (in future), by just few touches of the screen.
Also, it has a lot of helpful features, like NFC transfer, QR code for wallet address, contact book, and way more in the future.
